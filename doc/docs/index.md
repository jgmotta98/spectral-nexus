**Spectral Nexus** is an interactive tool for identifying chemical compounds based on the weighted analysis of FT-IR (Fourier-Transform Infrared) spectra. Designed with accessibility and precision in mind, the platform streamlines spectral analysis, making it easier for usersâ€”researchers, students, and professionals alikeâ€”to identify pesticide compounds through spectral matching and classification.
