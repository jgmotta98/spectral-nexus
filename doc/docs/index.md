**Spectral Nexus** is an interactive tool for identifying chemical compounds based on the weighted analysis of FT-IR (Fourier-Transform Infrared) spectra. Designed with accessibility and precision in mind, the platform streamlines spectral analysis, making it easier for usersâ€”researchers, students, and professionals alikeâ€”to identify pesticide compounds through spectral matching and classification.

## Getting Started

To get started with Spectral Nexus, follow the [Installation Guide](installation.md).

1. Upload your FT-IR spectrum CSV.
2. Let the system preprocess and match it against the database.
3. Review the top five matching compounds.
4. Download your report.
